;; Allow peer groups to leave

;; Store / recover state checkpoints in same way. Should be amongst the inputs (so need to look at more than just the input tasks)

;; For state you can just not reset state-events
;; The problem is that how do you know which sections of the log checkpoints to
;; restore, since some will be thrown away, while others will actually be
;; restored. When you do a restore, clean up the bits you didn't use? This can
;; be done by destroying any records that are later than the ones that you
;; want. This is a good somewhat temporary solution

;; The peer that recovers the slot is responsible for the cleanup

;; Peer leave - fix event switching
;; Peer re-add

;; State checkpointing can happen in emit-barriers
